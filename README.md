### Introduction
Our team has created a platform for people to contribute to approved charitable institutions. This application denotes an organization which helps impacted people and animal rescue/shelter receive funds for restoration. Different charities can register on our application and get approved to receive donations from application users.
Our application is called Relief Fund and it has three features â€“
* Spot Donation
* Registered Users can donate to already listed and approved charities
* Charity institutions can join our platform
